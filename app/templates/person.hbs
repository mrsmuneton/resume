<p>I am fascinated by systems and system interactions.  My favorite programming problems have to do with handoffs between systems, so I like writing and consuming APIs, connecting to shared credential systems, and finding ways to drive pertinent information into the users view out of a large data set.  I develop impactful solutions and crave challenging problems to solve with great teams.</p>
